# Simple Calculator using HTML, CSS, JS  
## 1) Description
Since I am a beginner to software development and I'm developing a keen interest in frontend development I used this small project to get an understanding about the basics of frontend development.
I followed several youtube tutorials and articles to obtain the knowledge and by using HTML, CSS and Javascript I made this small calculator.

### -Features
Addition , substraction, division, multiplication ,percentage are the basic operations that can be performed.
I have added brackets and decimals into the project as well.

Feel free to point out any mistakes that I have done, in issues.
